    "abstract": "Friends and family of former Colorado running back Rashaan Salaam, who won Heisman Trophy in 1994, are questioning whether his early career success had role in his suicide in early December; Salaam reached pinnacle of success at age 20 and subsequently had professional football career hobbled by injuries, central factor in his known depression--common symptom of brain disease, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, that has afflicted scores of players.",
