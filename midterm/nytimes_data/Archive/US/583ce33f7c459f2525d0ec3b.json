    "abstract": "Congress is set to approve 21st Century Cures Act, $6.3 billion health care policy bill that will increase funding for cancer research, address problems with nation's mental health system, stem widespread problem of opioid abuse and enact regulatory changes for drugs and medical devices; critics charge that act will make approval process for drugs and medical devices less costly and time-consuming and therefore less safe for consumers.",
