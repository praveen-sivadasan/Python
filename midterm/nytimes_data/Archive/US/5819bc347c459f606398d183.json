    "abstract": "Scott M Greene peacefully surrenders to Des Moines area authorities after fatally shooting Police Officers Anthony Beminio and Justin Martin in their patrol cars; local residents and officials express surprise at scale of Greene's violence despite being aware of his extensive history of criminal activity and personal troubles; shootings are latest in number of killings of law enforcement officers, trend that has intensified election-year debates about relations between communities and police.",
