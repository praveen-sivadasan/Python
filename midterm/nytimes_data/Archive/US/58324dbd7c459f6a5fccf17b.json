    "abstract": "Some residents of Election District 15 in Milwaukee discuss their reasons for not voting in election; area, populated mostly by blacks and known for its high rates of poverty and incarceration, experienced 19.5 percent drop in voter turnout from 2012; many cite disillusionment with Pres Obama and presidential contenders as reasons for not voting; city's election commission says new state photo ID requirement may have also contributed to decline by preventing thousands from voting.
