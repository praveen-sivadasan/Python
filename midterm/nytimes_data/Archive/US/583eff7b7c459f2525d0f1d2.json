    "abstract": "Mecklenburg County, NC, District Attorney R Andrew Murray declines to press charges against Police Officer Brentley Vinson in shooting death of black man Keith L Scott in Charlotte, NC, arguing circumstances justified shooting; key part of Murray's argument is video and digital image evidence that he says confirms Scott was armed and did not heed warnings to drop it when he was shot by Vinson, who is also black.",
