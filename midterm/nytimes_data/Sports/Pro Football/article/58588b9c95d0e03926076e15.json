    "abstract": "Former NFL tight end Ben Utecht, whose book Counting the Days While My Mind Slips Away details how repeated hits to head debilitated his life and career, has spent years since his 2010 retirement spreading awareness about dangers of concussions; critics suggest Utecht, journeyman player whose stint in league was just six seasons, is exploiting current controversy over concussions.",
