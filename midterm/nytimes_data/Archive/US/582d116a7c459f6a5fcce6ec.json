    "abstract": "Pres-elect Donald Trump is reportedly considering Sen Jeff Sessions for attorney general or secretary of defense, appointment that would revive past accusations of racial insensitivity; Sessions was denied nomination to federal distinct court judge under Pres Ronald Reagan in 1986 for making racial comments; potential nomination raises possibility that Trump administration will open with racially charged hearings.",
