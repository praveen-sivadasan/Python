    "abstract": "Pres-elect Donald Trump, during hourlong interview at New York Times, softens some of more extreme views espoused during campaign, but continues to flout some ethical and political conventions of American presidency; asserts he has no legal obligation to separate his business interests from presidency and defends strategist Stephen Bannon against charges of racism; appears to soften positions on torture and climate change.",
