    "abstract": "Examination by New York Times of Donald Trump's tax appeals on several of his properties, along with documents secured through Freedom of Information requests, reveals that numbers reported on his financial disclosure forms offer incomplete picture of Trump's financial state; it is virtually impossible to ascertain how much money Trump earns in any year, as he has chosen to list gross revenue figures instead of net income after expenses, suggesting that actual income from some of his businesses may be nowhere near what he has reported.",
