    "abstract": "United States District Court for Western District of Wisconsin rules, 2-1, that state Legislature's redrawing of State Assembly districts in 2011 in favor of Republicans was unconstitutional as it was partisan gerrymander; ruling is first in three decades to strike down gerrymander on partisan grounds; case can now go before Supreme Court, and should higher court affirm ruling it could have profound consequences for redistricting in 2021.",
