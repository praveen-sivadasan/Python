    "abstract": "Judge Richard M Gergel of Federal District Court in Charleston, SC, grants Dylann S Roof's request to represent himself in his hate crimes trial on charges of killing nine African-American members of Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church; death penalty experts say they believe Roof will decline to present evidence of his mental state during shooting, which could hamper jury's ability to assess his moral culpability.",
