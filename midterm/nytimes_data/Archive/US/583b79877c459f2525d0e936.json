    "abstract": "Mayors of New York, Los Angeles and other so-called sanctuary cities risk losing millions in federal funds by refusing to cooperate locally with Pres-elect Donald J Trump's proposal to deport millions of illegal immigrants; supporters of crackdown on undocumented immigrants expect Trump to make all-out effort to discourage such interference with federal agencies by local law enforcement officials.",
